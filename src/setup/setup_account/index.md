## Step 0: GitHub Account Setup

Duckietown uses [GitHub](https://github.com/duckietown) to distribute its open-source code and engage with
collaborators and end-users.  If you are unfamiliar with Git, we strongly recommend reading the following reference page to gain a 
working understanding of this tool: [The Duckietown Intro to Git](version_control_with_git).

If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can sign up for one at [this link](https://github.com/join).

In addition to the Github account you'll need to create an SSH key, to seamlessly access Github through terminal without having to enter the password each time. Follow the official Github documentation to create a SSH Key [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).  

Once you have a GitHub username and SSK key associated with your account, you can continue on to the next page to set up your Duckietown account.
