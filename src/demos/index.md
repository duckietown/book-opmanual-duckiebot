# Introduction to Demos

This section lists all Duckietown _demos_. By _demos_ we mean behaviors that are easily executed, but not explained. Demos are useful for doing rather than learning, e.g., to quickly test a behavior or showcase it in outreach circumstances. 

- **Supported**: these are polished demos that are actively maintained. You should be able to follow the instructions and obtain the expected outcomes without errors.

- **Legacy**: these demos are either under development or worked at some point in the past. This content is not actively supported at this point in time but might work if special attention is provided. We leave this non-polished content here to provide ideas on projects or classes. We welcome contributions to these materials. If you would like to see some of these demos moved to the "supported" section do not hesitate to let the Duckietown team know.
